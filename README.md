# 8bit-ALU-in-Verilog
This project is an implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The design was simulated and tested using Xilinx Vivado.

## 🛠️ Features

- Performs basic arithmetic and logic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - AND
  - OR
  - NAND
  - NOR
  - XOR
- Supports 8-bit inputs (A and B)
- Outputs 8-bit result and flags (e.g., Zero, Carry)

## 📁 Files Included

- alu8.v – Verilog source code for ALU
- alu8_tb.v – Testbench for simulation
- README.md – Project documentation

## 🧪 Tools Used

- *Vivado* – for writing, simulating, and verifying the design
- *GitHub* – for version control and documentation


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open Vivado
2. Create a new project and import alu8.v and alu8_tb.v
3. Run behavioral simulation
4. Observe the outputs for each operation
